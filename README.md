### Disclaimer
The sole purpose of this repository is learning.

The real world data comes from some data source and the best way of fetching the data is using SQL queries. You are not lucky everytime to have your data coming in CSV or some flat files.

The work on this repo was started during Christmas :christmas_tree: holidays and is really close to my :heart:

**Note:** If you find any discrepancy in the SQL queries for any question feel free :slightly_smiling_face: to raise an issue.
